# Set up an open source project

**GROUP ASSIGNMENT (4-5 students)**

**How to submit**: GitHub project set up

You are expected to create an open source project. You can just imagine something (a product you would implement or that you idealize), describing it and describing how it would be; or you can select any project any of the members of the group produced (*e.g.* as an assignment for other course, as a toy project, etc.). By following the information of Fogel's book (Chapter 2) [1] and opensource.guide [2, 3], make your project an Open Source project. For this moment, do not consider licensing, just make sure to create a good page, providing meaningful and complete documentation, and analyzing the items cited by the references aforementioned.

* Your project needs to be created under the NAU-OSS organization (https://github.com/NAU-OSS), so we can use it for future assignments.

You will be evaluated taking into consideration how adherent you project is with what is presented by Fogel and opensource.guide. The content of the pages created will be evaluated as essays.
