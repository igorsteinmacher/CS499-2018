Problem F1 - Conversion Functions

Summary

This project takes in a null terminated string 
representing a floating point and converts it into a
series of ints representing the float in parts and 
returns a bool indicating if it is a valid string. 
The number, converted to int, is returned with the passed
in pointers.

The system this code is to run on is very limited, with
the ability to only do integer arithmetic and process
null terminated strings. With this in mind, all code
needs to be adjusted to accomodate this.


Setup

Clone the git repository, cd into assignmentPR to view the code.
Compile with gcc, using the command make. Use the command make test to build and run the unit tests


Structure

The folder src contains the source code to the project.
The folder unit-test contains the test code for the project.
